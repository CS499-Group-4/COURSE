## üìå Project Overview
This system is a desktop application designed for university course scheduling. It allows administrative users to import course and faculty data, automatically generate a schedule that avoids room/time conflicts, and provide an interface for viewing, editing, and exporting that schedule. 
The application was built using Python with the Tkinter GUI toolkit and SQLAlchemy ORM for database interaction.

# üßë‚Äçüíª User Manual
1. Go to the **Upload** tab to upload the `.csv` files  
2. Click **Confirm** to add files to the schedule generator  
3. Use **View Files** to manually add additional information not previously uploaded  
4. Navigate the tabs at the top of **View Files** to add specific data (Courses, Faculty, etc.)  
    > Click **Add** to insert entries  
    > Right-click on data rows to **Delete** entries  
5. Select **Generate Schedule** from the sidebar and press **Start** to generate the schedule  
6. Review schedule conflicts under **Conflict Summary**  
7. Navigate to **Export Schedule**, choose a filter (optional)  
8. Click **Export** to download the schedule as both `.csv` and `.pdf`  
    > Tooltips are available by hovering over buttons and fields for additional help

# üóÇ Source Files and Folder Structure

## üñ• Pages

This project is organized using modular page-based Tkinter views. Each of these is implemented as a `tk.Frame` class and rendered by a central `controller`.

- `homePage.py`‚Äì Welcome page with application overview and navigation panel. Contains logo, usage instructions, and navigation buttons on the left.
- `uploadPage.py` ‚Äì  File uploader with drag-and-drop support. Shows files in a Treeview, with "Confirm" to parse and load data. Uploads are remembered across sessions.
- `viewPage_overall.py` ‚Äì Dashboard-like view that shows a summary of all courses, faculty, rooms, preferences, and time slots. 
- `viewPage_course.py` ‚Äì  Dedicated view to see, add, and remove course entries, including course ID, department, capacity, and required rooms
- `viewPage_faculty.py` ‚Äì View and manage professor records. Allows assigning up to five courses per professor with priorities.
- `viewPage_preference.py` ‚Äì Set room, day, and time preferences for each faculty member. Preferences are stored in the database and used during scheduling.
- `viewPage_rooms.py` ‚Äì List and manage classroom records including room ID, department, building, and capacity.
- `viewPage_times.py` ‚Äì Define and manage available time slots. Each slot includes days, start time, and end time.
- `startPage.py` ‚Äì Scheduler runner. Lets the user start the auto-scheduling process, review scheduling status, and inspect conflict groups.
- `exportPage.py` ‚Äì Lets the user filter the final schedule by Faculty, Room, or Department and export it to both CSV and PDF. Includes two dropdowns and a TreeView for review.
- `settingPage.py` ‚Äì Under construction.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Logic / Utils

- `Scheduler.py` ‚Äì generates conflict-aware schedules with:

  - Prioritized time slot assignment.
  - Faculty preference validation (room, day, time).
  - Course ‚Üí Professor ‚Üí Room allocation logic.
  - Conflict detection (room double-booking, room capacity, professor overlap).

- `CSV_Parser.py` ‚Äì parses input from:

  - Spreadsheet-style CSV (`parse_csv`)
  - old parse no longer use (`parse_csv_2`) 

- `CSV_Exporter.py` ‚Äì generates `.csv` and `.pdf` exports of scheduled data using FPDF.

  - Supports filtering by Faculty, Room, or Department.
  - Outputs include: course ID, assigned room, timeslot, instructor, capacity.

- `DatabaseManager.py` ‚Äì ORM-based DB manager built on SQLAlchemy:

  - Defines table schemas for `Faculty`, `Course`, `Classroom`, `TimeSlot`, `Preference`, `Schedule`.
  - CRUD operations for each table.
  - Robust integrity checking and rollback support.

## üñº Assets

Assets are organized into folders by view:

- `frame_export/`, `frame_setting/`, `frame_start/`, `frame_upload/`
- `frame_view/`, `frame_view_course/`, `frame_view_faculty/`, `frame_view_overall/`
- `frame_view_preference/`, `frame_view_rooms/`, `frame_view_times/`
- `framehome/`

**Design tools used:**

- UI prototyped in **Figma**
- Converted to Python with [Tkinter Designer](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer)
- Icons sourced from [IconFinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/)

**Color Palette:**

- `#0A4578` ‚Äì Deep Blue
- `#7ABDF8` ‚Äì Light Blue
- `#FFFFFF` ‚Äì White
- `#DAEBFA` ‚Äì Soft Blue
- `#A3D1F9` ‚Äì Mid Blue

# üß∞ Scheduling Algorithm Details

Location: `lib/Scheduler.py`

### Steps:
1. **Sort** courses with required room or faculty preferences
2. **Assign** timeslots based on time/day preferences
3. **Verify** room and professor availability
4. **Fallback** to non-preferred options if needed
5. **Commit** valid schedule entry to the database
6. **Detect conflicts** with `validate_faculty_preferences()`
   - Room mismatch with preference or course requirement
   - Professor double-booking
   - Room capacity overflow
   - Time/day preference violations

üí° **Note:** The `SettingPage` is currently under construction. Features like font/theme toggles and layout preferences will be added in future updates.
