## üìå Project Overview
This system is a desktop application designed for university course scheduling. It allows administrative users to import course and faculty data, automatically generate a schedule that avoids room/time conflicts, and provide an interface for viewing, editing, and exporting that schedule. 
The application was built using Python with the Tkinter GUI toolkit and SQLAlchemy ORM for database interaction.

# üî® Building The Executable
1. Ensure you're on a windows machine with Python3 installed (this should be default with any standard windows install)
2. In the COURSE folder, run **Build.bat**
3. After completion, the executable can be found in the **build** folder

---

# üßë‚Äçüíª User Manual
1. Go to the **Upload** tab to upload the `.csv` files  
2. Click **Confirm** to add files to the schedule generator  
3. Use **View Files** to manually add additional information not previously uploaded  
4. Navigate the tabs at the top of **View Files** to add specific data (Courses, Faculty, etc.)  
    > Click **Add** to insert entries  
    > Right-click on data rows to **Delete** entries  
5. Select **Generate Schedule** from the sidebar and press **Start** to generate the schedule  
6. Double-Clock on values to make changes to the schedule to make desired changes and/or resolve conflicts.
    > Select **Update** to commit changes to the schedule. Erorrs or warnings will show here if some changes cannot be made.
    > In case you'd like to revert changes that were unable to be committed, you can select **Start** again to revert uncommitted changes.
7. Review schedule conflicts under **Conflict Summary**  
8. Navigate to **Export Schedule**, choose a filter (optional)  
9. Click **Export** to download the schedule as both `.csv` and `.pdf`  
    > Tooltips are available by hovering over buttons and fields for additional help

### Resetting to generate a new schedule
When you've finished generating your schedule or would like to undo your progress thus far to restart you must:
1. Close the application
2. In the application's directory remove the following:
    > course.db file
    > uploads folder
3. Relaunch the app and it's ready to go again!

# üóÇ Source Files and Folder Structure

## üñ• Pages

This project is organized using modular page-based Tkinter views. Each of these is implemented as a `tk.Frame` class and rendered by a central `controller`.

- `homePage.py`‚Äì Welcome page with application overview and navigation panel. Contains logo, usage instructions, and navigation buttons on the left.
  
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a29aae77-d47f-4671-a866-00a9cd19ca4c" alt="course_logo" height="400">

- `uploadPage.py` ‚Äì  File uploader with drag-and-drop support. Shows files in a Treeview, with "Confirm" to parse and load data. Uploads are remembered across sessions.

- `viewPage_overall.py` ‚Äì Dashboard-like view that shows a summary of all courses, faculty, rooms, preferences, and time slots.
  
   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e9dba73-fd46-4eac-b8dd-b6fe971eee88" alt="course_logo" height="400">

- `viewPage_preference.py` ‚Äì Set room, day, and time preferences for each faculty member. Preferences are stored in the database and used during scheduling.
  
   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c65335f8-97e8-4694-bb95-df680676c6a3" alt="course_logo" height="400">

- `viewPage_rooms.py` ‚Äì List and manage classroom records including room ID, department, building, and capacity.
  
   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aca7cba-f039-45f6-9478-1ecc21079bce" alt="course_logo" height="400">

- `viewPage_times.py` ‚Äì Define and manage available time slots. Each slot includes days, start time, and end time.
  
   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c45f41cb-ae6b-42a9-89f8-8cfb8af395a8" alt="course_logo" height="400">

- `startPage.py` ‚Äì Scheduler runner. Lets the user start the auto-scheduling process, review scheduling status, and inspect conflict groups.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Logic / Utils

- `Scheduler.py` ‚Äì generates conflict-aware schedules with:

  - Prioritized time slot assignment.
  - Faculty preference validation (room, day, time).
  - Course ‚Üí Professor ‚Üí Room allocation logic.
  - Conflict detection (room double-booking, room capacity, professor overlap).

- `CSV_Parser.py` ‚Äì parses input from:

  - Spreadsheet-style CSV (`parse_csv`)
  - old parse no longer use (`parse_csv_2`) 

- `CSV_Exporter.py` ‚Äì generates `.csv` and `.pdf` exports of scheduled data using FPDF.

  - Supports filtering by Faculty, Room, or Department.
  - Outputs include: course ID, assigned room, timeslot, instructor, capacity.

- `DatabaseManager.py` ‚Äì ORM-based DB manager built on SQLAlchemy:

  - Defines table schemas for `Faculty`, `Course`, `Classroom`, `TimeSlot`, `Preference`, `Schedule`.
  - CRUD operations for each table.
  - Robust integrity checking and rollback support.

# üß∞ Scheduling Algorithm Details

Location: `lib/Scheduler.py`

### Steps:
1. **Sort** courses with required room or faculty preferences
2. **Assign** timeslots based on time/day preferences
3. **Verify** room and professor availability
4. **Fallback** to non-preferred options if needed
5. **Commit** valid schedule entry to the database
6. **Detect conflicts** with `validate_faculty_preferences()`
   - Room mismatch with preference or course requirement
   - Professor double-booking
   - Room capacity overflow
   - Time/day preference violations

---

üí° **Note:** The `SettingPage` is currently under construction. Features like font/theme toggles and layout preferences will be added in future updates.
